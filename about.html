                    <h2>Design Guidelines.</h2>
                    <p>I paid special attention to Treehouse's "5 Design Tips Every Developer Should Know". Their advice about using plenty of negative space and high levels of contrast definitely helped me make my site look more professional. I also took inspiration from HubSpot's "8 Guidelines for Exceptional Web Design, Usability, and User Experience" in designing my navigation bar(i.e. keeping it in a consistent position). My site also conforms to all the web conventions they discuss in their article. </p>

                    <h2>Likes and Dislikes.</h2>
                    <p>The single part of this site that I'm most proud of is the color scheme. It's significantly better than what I chose for the Resume activity, and I think my font choices accentuate that as well. I also like the design of my navigation bar at the top of the page, with my profile picture, name, and links to different pages.</p>
                    <p>As far as dislikes are concerned, I wish I had been able to figure out a good way to leave breadcrumbs. I know it was recommended in several of the design articles, and I sort of understood the idea but I couldn't figure out how to best implement that for my site. I also wish I could have made my site responsive, but I ran out of time.</p>
