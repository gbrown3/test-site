                <td class="project_desc">I lead a team of students to continually update and improve the iOS app for my schoolâ€™s newspaper, The Mac Weekly. I spent this past summer learning Swift and working on projects like implementing the backend of our login system. This semester onward, in addition to further developing the app I will work with the lead developer of our Android app to set deadlines, recruit new students and publicize our app.</td>

Stepquencer is highly customizable and made for beginners and tinkerers alike. I served as the project manager, setting deadlines and keeping my team members on task. I also implemented the layout of every screen on the app and the logic behind using multiple instruments at once. Stepquencer is currently available on the Apple App Store, and has accrued 3,500+ downloads as of September 2018.</td>

                <td class="project_desc">I worked on a team with Dr. Bret Jackson to design and develop a 3D user interface for selecting 3D surfaces in Virtual Reality (VR). The 3D selection interface I helped implement allows users to progressively refine their selections, and make more specific selections than possible with other tools. I implemented a method for teleporting around the virtual space and a menu for switching states (we used the State design pattern). I also learned how to programmatically draw and interact with geometric meshes. We summarized our findings in a paper, which was accepted and presented at the IEEE VR 2018 Conference.</td>
